### Python - Wonder Mail S Generator

Run `WonderMailSGenerator.py`. Not all input cases tested - seems to work pretty well though

If using the European version, edit the `IS_EUROPEAN = True` in the file (or just use the WMSGen class for full control over inputs).

### Notes:

- This Python generator may give different codes to the html/js version, even when using a fixed seed. I haven't figured out why, but the passwords still work.
